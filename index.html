        My dearest Divya, as we celebrate our 11th anniversary, my heart overflows with gratitude and love for you. From the moment we met, you've been the light that guides me through every day. Your smile, your laughter, and your unwavering support have made these years the most beautiful chapter of my life. I cherish every memory we've created together—the adventures, the quiet moments, and the dreams we've built. You are my forever, my soulmate, and my greatest joy. Here's to many more years of love, laughter, and endless happiness. I love you more than words can express. Happy Anniversary!
